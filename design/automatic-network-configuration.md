# Automatic network configuration

## Status

provisional

## Summary

This proposal is to expand the scope of Metal³ to include an API to
manage physical network devices.

## Motivation

Metal³ follows the paradigm of Kubernetes Native Infrastructure (KNI),
which is an approach to use Kubernetes to manage underlying infrastructure.
Managing the configuration of some physical network devices is closely
related to managing physical hosts.
As bare metal hosts are provisioned or later repurposed, there may be
corresponding physical network changes that must be made, such as
reconfiguring a ToR switch port. If the provisioning of the physical
host is managed through a Kubernetes API, it would be convenient to be
able to reconfigure related network devices using a similar API.

### Goals

* Define a Kubernetes API for configuring network switches.
* Automatically configure the network infrastructure for a host
  when adding it to a cluster.
* Do network configuration when deprovisioning the hosts.
* Design a network abstraction that can represent any of the target
  networking configuration, independently of the controller used.

### Non-Goals

* Implement a network controller which is aimed at being an integration
  with an existing controller only.
* Implement a solution for a specific underlying infrastructure.
* Implement a solution for link aggregation in the future.
* Implement a solution for lldp in the future.

## Proposal

This document proposes to add a new mechanic to automatically perform
physical network device configuration before provisioning a BareMetalHost.
Frist we added the NetworkConfiguration operator to implement the network
configuration of the device. Then we added some methods to CAPM3 to
implement together. When network configuration is required, CAPM3 will
process some content through additional methods, and then trigger the
NetworkConfiguration operator to perform network configuration.

### User Stories

#### Story 1

As a consumer of Metal³, when adding a machine resource to the cluster,
according to the network configuration of the cluster, the physical host
is connected to the corresponding logical layer-2 network segment.

#### Story 2

As a consumer of Metal³, when a machine is deleted from the cluster,
the corresponding network configuration is automatically deleted.

#### Story 3

As a user/admin a SmartNIC that is hosted in a BMH needs to be provisioned,
pre-configured, and then capable of in operation management.

Physical server(OS) -----> SmartNIC [virtual switch(OVS)
---> physical NIC] ←-- (LAN cable)-----> PortID

#### Story 4

As a user, when creating a network configuration and specifying link aggregation,
the related BMH and siwtch can be automatically configured.

#### Story 5

As a user, when creating a network configuration, it is possible to configure ACL
settings in a switch for each bare metal server according to its functionality.
The ACL setting:

* Direction: ingress or egress
* Protocol: SSH, HTTP, …all
* Action: allow, deny
* Port status: up, down (status of the switch port)

## Design Details

### Structure

In the networkConfiguration operator, we abstract the following roles:

#### Device

Abstract all devices in the cluster (such as Switch, SmartNic).

Each type of network device must have its own CRD.

##### Port

Indicates the specific port of the network device.

```go
// PortManager is used to control the `Port`
type PortManager interface {
    // ConfigurePort set the network configure to the port
    ConfigurePort(ctx context.Context, configuration interface{}) error
    // DeConfigurePort remove the network configure from the port
    DeConfigurePort(ctx context.Context) error
    // CheckConfigutation checks whether the configuration is
    // configured on the port
    CheckConfigutation(ctx context.Context) bool
}
```

Each type of `Port` must have its own CRD and implements corresponding
`PortManager` interface.

#### Configuration

Indicates the content of the specific configuration of each port.
Each type of `Configuration` must have its own CRD

#### Port Controller

Each `Device` must have its own `Port controller` to monitor the corresponding
`Port`, and connect to `Device` to change the configuration of the
corresponding port according to the `Port` change.Each Port controller must
implement the method of configuring `Device` specified by the `Device.spec.protocol`.

#### State machine for the controller

Port controller sets 6 states for `Port.status.state`: `None`, `Created`, `Configuring`,
`Configured`, `Deleting` and `Deleted`, each state has its own corresponding function.

* \<None\>
  1. Indicates the status of the Port CR when it was first created, and the value
     of `status.state` is nil.
  2. The state handler will add finalizers to the Port CR to avoid being deleted,
     and set the state of CR to `Created`
* Created
  1. Indicates waiting for spec.configurationRef to be assigned.
  2. The state handler check spec.configurationRef's value, if isn't nil set the
     state of CR to `Configuring`
* Configuring
  1. Indicates that the port is being configured.
  2. The state handler configure port's network and check configuration progress.
     If finished set the state of CR to `Configured` state
* Configured
  1. Indicates that the port configuration is complete.
  2. The state handler check whether the target configuration is consistent with
     the actual configuration, return to `Configuring` state and clean `status.configurationRef`
     when inconsistent
* Cleaning
  1. Indicates that the port configuration is being cleared.
  2. The state handler deconfigure port's network and check deconfiguration progress,
     when finished clean `spec.configurationRef` and `status.configurationRef` then set
     CR's state to `Cleaned` state.
* Cleaned
  1. Indicates that the port configuration has been cleared.
  2. The state handler will remove finalizers, if `spec.configurationRef` isn't nil set CR's state to \<none\>

### Workflow

Create CR related to BMH's network:

* Administrator creates the corresponding `Device` CR according to the
  specific network device.
* Administrator creates a `BareMetalHost` CR and fills in the content in `bmh.spec.ports`
  according to the actual network connection.
* Administrator creates a corresponding `Port` CR for each port of the network device
  connected to the BMH network card.

Create Metal3Machine:

* User creates `Configuration` corresponding to the `Device`.
* User specifies the `spec.networkConfiguration` field when creating `Metal3Machine`
  CR.
* CAPM3 filter the BMH by calling the filter() function. Then select a BMH
  according to the original method.
* Before provisioning, if the machine's `networkConfiguration` field is not empty,
  CAPM3 will calls the `configureNetwork()` method to fill networkConfiguration into
  the appropriate `Port.spec.configurationRef`.
* The Port controller detects that `Port.spec.configurationRef` changes from empty
  to non-empty, then carry out the corresponding processing.
* BMO detects that the status.state of the Port CR corresponding to all BMH network
  cards is empty or `Configured`, and then continues to provision BMH.

Remove Metal3Machine:

* User deletes the `Metal3Machine` CR.
* CAPM3 calls the `deconfigureNetwork()` to find all the `Port` CR corresponding
  to the BMO network cards, and clear their `spec.configurationRef`.
* Port  controller starts to deconfigure the network by call device.DeConfigurePort().
* BMO detects that the status.state of the Port CR corresponding to all BMH network
  cards is empty or `Deleted`, and then continue to deprovision BMH.

### Changes to Current API

#### Metal3Machine CRD

```yaml
spec:
  # Specify the network configuration that metal3Machine needs to use
  networkConfiguration:
  # no smartNic
  - ConfigurationRef:
      name: nc1
      kind: SwitchPortConfiguration
      namespace: default
    # Network card performance required for this network configuration
    nicHint:
      name: eth0
      smartNIC: false
  # with smartNic
  - ConfigurationRef:
      name: nc1
      kind: SmartNicConfiguration
      namespace:  default
    nicHint:
      name: eth1
      smartNIC: true
```

#### BareMetalHost

Add the `ports` field to `.spec` to indicate the connection information
and performance of all network cards in the `BareMetalHost`.

``` yaml
spec:
  ports:
    - mac: 00:00:00:00:00:00
      portRef:
        name: port0
        kind: SwitchPort
        namespace: default
   - mac:
   ......
```

#### CAPM3

Add the following methods in `metal3machine_manager.go`:

* filter([]\*BareMetalHost smartNIC bool) []\*BareMetalHost

  According to the incoming `BareMetalHost` array and conditions, filter out
  eligible BMHs to return.

* configureNetwork()

  configureNetwork() find the corresponding network card in `BMH.status.nics`
  according to the content of the `spec.nicHint.name` field in the
  `networkConfiguration` CR, and then find the corresponding port in `BMH.spec.ports`
  according to `BMH.status.nics.mac`, and then find the corresponding `Port` CR,
  full networkConfiguration into `spec.networkConfigurationRef`.

* deconfigureNetwork()

  deconfigureNetwork() finds the Port CR corresponding to all its network cards
  according to the incoming BMH, and clears its `spec.networkConfigurationRef`.

### Add new CRD and controller
